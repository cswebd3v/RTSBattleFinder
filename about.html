    <h1><span class="white">About</span> RTS BattleFinder</h1>
    <p>
        Many armchair generals such as myself remember playing the Real Time Strategy games of the 1990's and early 2000's with great fondness. 
        Sure, we may visit other genres and games for awhile, sometimes maybe even years, but true RTS fans always come back. We're constantly 
        searching for that next faction to lose ourselves in as we muster armies and conquer foes.

        As an outspoken RTS enthusiast, I'm repeatedly being asked for suggestions on which games to play, and which games have the most active playerbases. 
        So I decided to make a tool that will answer that question automatically. RTS BattleFinder reaches out to the SteamAPI and gathers the player count
        of the games that I've designated.
